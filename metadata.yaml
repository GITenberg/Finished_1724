description: "Finished is a 1917 novel by H. Rider Haggard featuring Allan Quatermain.\
  \ It is the last in a trilogy about the Zulu kingdom, which also includes Marie\
  \ and Child of Storm, and involved the dwarf Zikali.\nIt is set against the background\
  \ of the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, covering events leading up to the war, and ending\
  \ with the death of Cetewayo. Quatermain is depicted as being one of the few survivors\
  \ of the Battle of Isandhlwana. Like others in the series, several real-life characters\
  \ appear, such as Cetewayo and Anthony Durnford.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
